# A practical tutorial for making a simple machine learning project from A-Z.
<br/>
In the tutorial, we will study all the subjects (except Business Understanding) that are described in the above diagram(CRISP-DM).
<br/>
From data processing throw popular machine learning algorithms to data visualization in the end.
<br/>
We will mainly learn how to use Python's Sklearn package to run 8 supervised ML algorithms and 1 unsupervised algorithm.
<br/>
